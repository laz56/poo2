 ### OOP UPB SEM 2 PROJECT Made by Lazar Iulian
 
# The Dungeon Quest

A small game where you can choose a class and fight with different monsters!
##  5 levels to complete!
## Shop with coins system!
## Difficulties!

### How it works?

The 'Enemies' class has 5 derivatives with unique features;
The 'Player' class has 3 derivatives wich you can choose from in the starting menu;
The game uses some void() functions to draw art, or even pass the levels;
When choosing a certain difficulty all the monsters are increasing life and damage;

Compiled on Visual Studio IDE(recommended);
Also works on Clion console(a little laggy);

I also recommend you to compile the code in a x64 console app for the best experience <3
